# Here's Trouble Plugin
Don't you think "Here's trouble" anytime you see that one friend who can't do 150 TOAs but TOBs with their eyes shut?
This plugin is for you!

Any time a clanmate or friend comes onto your screen, you will say out loud "Here's Trouble" as well as be thinking it. This will reset anytime you log out or if your friend/clanmate logs out.

Current configs are to toggle on/off friends and clanmembers, as well as the volume of the plugin itself. Please let me know if you find any issues I've missed!
